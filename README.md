# 30js
 30 mini Javascript projects for 30 days (April) 

 Starting from today 1st of April to 30th of April, I will be building mini javascript projects.

 For every day, I'll build a project.

 This is an attempt at improving my front end development skills especially javascript.

 Each project will have its folder.
